Press enter to roll your dice
```

The first line tells which round it is, which player's turn it is and how many rolls the player has left in the current round.

The numbered rows below the line "Current score boxes" shows which boxes the player still has left to fill.

Now press enter and you'll see something like this:

```
Rolled dice:

| ..... | 2.... | 2.... | 4...4 | 5...5 |
| ..1.. | ..... | ..... | ..... | ..5.. |
| ..... | ....2 | ....2 | 4...4 | 5...5 |

Enter the dice you want to keep (e.g.: 123):
```

The ASCII text shows which dice the player got. To select one or more dice, simply enter the number(s) of the corresponding dice, e.g. `5` to select the five. To re-roll all dice, leave the input empty and press enter.

When the player has selected one or more dice from a previous turn, the selected dice will show up separately to the right like this:

```
| 3.... | 3.... | 5...5 | 5...5 |       | 5...5 |
| ..3.. | ..3.. | ..5.. | ..5.. | ..... | ..5.. |
| ....3 | ....3 | 5...5 | 5...5 |       | 5...5 |
```

Important: The selected dice from a previous turn must be selected again if you still want to keep them. In the above example you would enter `555` to select all fives.

### Save score

The numbered rows shows which score boxes are available to fill and also how many points each box is worth based on the dice. The column "Max score" show the maximum point that a row can give. If your TMP score is equal to the maximum score, it will show up in green.

To select a score box enter its corresponding number. For example; To add 23 points to "Full house" the player would enter `13`

When the player has selected a score box, the turn goes to the next player.
